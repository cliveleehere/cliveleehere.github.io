I had a change to attend and speak at Droidcon Boston again this year, and heard some amazing talks. I wanted to do a quick write up, with key takeaways.

Here's the [link to the agenda](https://www.droidcon-boston.com/agenda/), and a [link to some of the slides](https://github.com/Droidcon-Boston/slides/tree/master/2019)

#### Destination Navigation
This talk, given by Eric Maxwell, was a detailed overview on how to use Navigation Component. There was a lot of useful info here, and I got a great sense of some of advantages of using Navigation Component, including simpler deeplinks.  There were also some practical suggestions for migrating to Navigation Components, including steps to reducing the number of activities.

#### Select * From Kotlin
Give by the Mr. Handstand himself, this talk went into couple of database libraries that are great for use with Kotlin: Room and Sqldelight. He compared and contrasted the features and how to use them. The general sense I got was that it's better to stick with Room for now.
