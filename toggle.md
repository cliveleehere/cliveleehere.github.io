Quickest way to create Toggl time entries on your Android device. Create widgets on your home screen. With these widgets you can start and stop time entries, right from the home screen with a single press of your finger! You can specify the project as well as the description for the widgets. Each widget can be re-sized horizontally, to show more or less of the text.

This app is not made by Toggl; users must create a Toggl acocunt separately. This app does use Toggl's public API.

Now you can place a 'refresh' widget right on your home screen. Pressing the refresh widget will refresh all your other widgets so that you can find which time entry is running right away! Useful if you use multiple devices / laptop / browser!
